      <br>
    The story follows the main character, Sophie Hatter. Her uneventful life changes when she befriends a charming and handsome wizard, Howl, who lives in a magical flying castle.

    <p class="paragraph"> Sophie Hatter </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Sophie Hatter (ソフィー・ハッター, Sofī Hattā) is the female protagonist and heroine. Sophie,the edlest of three sisters, is an 18 years-old woman living in the small town of Market Chipping in the kingdom of Ingary. In the land of Ingary, Sophie is destined to never find her fortune and live a dull life at home. She works in her late father's hat shop as her stepmother, Fanny Hatter's, apprentice.
    <br>
    Although Sophie is initially reserved and lacking confidence, she demonstrates herself to be a strong-willed individual after she is cursed into becoming an old woman, becoming less afraid of what others think of her. Dutiful, kind, and considerate, Sophie also has a tendency to be impulsive in her actions and often feels guilty when she does something wrong, though her attempts to rectify matters are usually disastrous. She is a very compassionate individual and often tries to help others, no matter who they are, going so far as taking the Witch of the Waste under her protection. It is eventually revealed that Sophie possesses magical abilities of her own - she is capable of talking life into objects, though she initially is unaware of her powers and uses them unwittingly. When developed, they become very powerful.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Howl Jenkins Pendragon </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Howl Jenkins Pendragon (ハウル・ジェンキンス・ペンドラゴン, Hauru Jenkinsu Pendoragon) is a powerful wizard living in the land of Ingary. Originally Howell Jenkins of Wales, he was part of a loose fraternity of wizards on Earth. He made his way through a magical portal to Ingary, where he became known and respected as one of the most powerful wizards there was. He owns a moving castle, and spreads rumors about himself to retain his privacy, opting to be alone and hiding from all conflict.
    <br>
    Howl Jenkins was born to an ordinary family in modern-day Wales. However, he himself was anything but ordinary. Gifted with a natural talent for magic, he began studying it. Even in college, he wrote his thesis on magical spells and charms, and joined a group of other gifted magicians on Earth. In Wales, Howl had a habit of going out with girls and then jilting them. In an attempt to hide from his wrong doing, he cast a spell that opened a portal to another land, Ingary, where he moved almost permanently. Still young, he took up tutelage under Mrs. Pentstemmon (Madame Suliman). He became her last pupil, and one of her favorites and best. His natural gift for magic showed, and he was quite powerful. He was in the same league as the Witch of the Waste. Howl is a wizard in the land of Ingary and he has several names; he is known as Wizard Howl in Market Chipping, "Wizard Pendragon" in the capital Kingsbury, and "Jenkins the Sorcerer" in lower-class Porthaven.
    <br>
    He uses charms and make up to make himself more attractive, as well as having a naturally engaging personality. Howl has a kind, generous personality. He allowed Markl and Sophie to live with him, and is very forgiving of their mistakes. Hegave Calcifer his heart when Calcifer was a dying falling star. His good traits, however, are masked by his more negative traits, as well as deliberate "blackening of his name", so very few people know of them. He hates to quarrel, and will slither out of situations he doesn't want to be in. He hates to be pinned down to anything, and is quite cowardly. Howl has a somewhat child-like attitude, begging for attention and even throwing a tantrum. Despite his attention-seeking, self-absorbed nature, he's quite kind. </p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Calcifer </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Calcifer (カルシファー , Karushifā) is a Fire Demon in a magical contract with Howl. He used to be a falling star, whom Howl was able to catch before he fell to earth and extinguished. He is a very powerful creature himself, with a great deal of magical ability, though cannot move beyond the confines of the hearth in which Howl keeps him without the wizard's help.
    <br>
    Calcifer is not always trustworthy. He was negligent to tell Howl that Sophie and many other characters were under spells. He sometimes refuses to warn Howl of another demons, even when they could have killed both him and Howl. However, he does keep his word when he promises to lift the spell of Sophie if she breaks his contract with Howl. He tends to whine a lot and can be a little bit nasty. However, he is loyal, choosing to stay with Howl even though the contract has been broken.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Markl </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Markl (マルクル , Marukuru) is Howl's apprentice. Not much of his background or past is revealed, except for his first name and that he is training under Howl to become a wizard. He manages Howl's affairs while he is away, dealing with customers in the different towns linked to by the portal. The only notable magic he ever does is put on a cloak and take on the appearance of a short, old wizard with a large beard. His voice gets huskier and deeper in this form. Initially, he is suspicious of Sophie's presence in the castle, addressing her as 'Grandma', but he eventually forms a close bond with her as they are together every day. Most of his time is spent on shopping for food with Sophie, cooking, and other chores such as laundry.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Turnip Head </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Turnip Head, (かかしのカブ , Kakashi no Kabu, lit. "Scarecrow Turnip") is a cursed scarecrow on two cross poles wearing torn clothing with a withering turnip for a head. Turnip-Head appears to Sophie Hatter while she is fleeing Market Chipping. She sees that his main pole protruding from a shrub and lifts it out to reveal him.Turnip-Head seems to take quite a liking to Sophie and follows her everywhere, popping up here and there throughout the movie. Turnip-Head finds Sophie a cane, retrieves her shawl, holds an umbrella for her when she's out in the rain and even gives a helping hand with the washing.
    <br>
    Near the end of the movie, whilst trying to stop the board that Sophie, Markl, Howl, The Witch of the Waste, Hin, and Calcifer are sliding down a cliff on, his pole snaps but he slows the fall thus saving everyone. After reviving Howl by putting his heart back into his chest, Sophie kisses Turnip-Head and the curse is broken through "true love's kiss". Turnip-Head is revealed to be an important character who is the key to ending the war.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Witch of the Waste </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> The Witch of the Waste (荒地の魔女, Arechi no Majo) is the former secondary antagonist. She is a talented witch who was so beautiful that Howl pursued her, but after finding out that she used magic to keep herself looking young and beautiful, he left her. She is still in love with Howl and uses her magical powers and henchmen to try and capture him after seeing him with Sophie. Full of jealousy and hatred, she arrives at night to Sophie's hat shop, and insults her before turning her into a 90 year-old woman.
    <br>
    Initially the antagonist, the Witch becomes somewhat of a protagonist after Madame Suliman lures her to the castle to drain her of her magical powers, restoring the Witch to her actual appearance and age, and replacing her as the antagonist in the movie.

    <p class="paragraph"> Madame Suliman </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Madame Suliman (サリマン , Sariman) is the main antagonist. Madame Suliman serves as the King's Royal Sorcerer who provides magic for the country's military forces and the King's personal use. She uses her power to hunt down wizards and witches across the kingdom, taking them in as apprentices and turning them into monsters to serve in the army, or stripping them of their power if they refuse. Madame Suliman has a special liking for Howl as she expresses her regret of Howl not arriving to the palace saying that she had finally found someone that could replace her. She says this to Sophie who is posing as Howl's mother upon his request to avoid going to the palace. Madame Suliman however realises who Sophie truly is, and that she is in love with Howl. Howl arrives at the castle disguised as the King, Madame Suliman recognises him because of his 'eloquent' speech and the real King's appearance. As Howl proceeds to leave, Madame Suliman casts a spell revealing to Sophie what Howl 'really' is, his beast/feathered form.
    <br>
    Madame Suliman has proven to be a very powerful witch since even Howl has a certain respect and care for her, she is able to take away the magic of very powerful wizards and witches such as The Waste Witch, cast powerful illusion and revelation spells just by moving her staff and even make cursed people reveal their cursed forms.
